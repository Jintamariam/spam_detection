## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection, which has been widely used for spam detection research.


## Project Structure
The Jupyter Notebook file `Spam_Collection.ipynb` is organized into the following sections:
1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, cleaning the data, and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of spam vs. non-spam messages.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal to extract relevant features.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models to classify SMS messages.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
